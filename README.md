A list of excellent works on various stages of Sign Language Production (SLP) (automatic translation from spoken sentences to sign language sequences). It contains an extensive literature review on the field of deep learning-based sign language generation, sign language synthesis, sign language avatar recovery, pose estimation, and all related publications.

I am gathering these papers as literature for my PhD, and thought others may be interested. If you have any updates, please feel free to contribute or email me at [2021111446@mail.hfut.edu.cn](2021111446@mail.hfut.edu.cn).
